## By Aaron Olson and Dzhalalov
Source data and codes for the ICS-613 Big Data Processing group project.
We analyzed a US car sales dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsaustin/us-used-car-sales-data
The project is comprised of an Ipython notebook running pyspark (we ran it on databricks cummunity edition).
